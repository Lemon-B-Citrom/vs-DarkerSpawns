# Darker Spawns

Vintage Story mod that forces hostile mobs to spawn in darker light levels. By default, drifters spawn in light level 7 or lower. For reference, 11 is the brightness directly on a torch block, 22 is direct daylight, and 0 is pitch black/night time.

This mod changes the maximum spawnable light level for drifters to "1", ensuring that even dimly lit abodes should be safe to return to, especially in the winter where snow sometimes *forces* mobs to spawn in your homestead. Bells and sawblade locuts now have maximum light level of "0".
